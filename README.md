Tableau Visualizations
We will use Tableau 2021.4 to make several charts about the world and per country GDP. For this reason, we combine two datasets that are included in the Data file. The "GDP_PER_COUNTRY.xlsx," which you can find at the following link: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=PE, consists of the GDP per country and its evolution in years from 1960 to 2020. Furthermore, we use the dataset "DataGeographies_v1_byGapminder.xlsx," which you can find at the following link: https://www.gapminder.org/data/, to take the geolocation of each country (i.e., Latitude and Longitude fields).
